    1.What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span> <br />
<span className='font-bold'>Access Token</span><br />
    An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources on behalf of a user. It is typically a short-lived token with an expiration time.
When a user logs in or authenticates, an access token is issued to them. This token is included in subsequent API requests as an authorization header or in the request payload.
The server validates the access token to ensure the user is authorized to access the requested resource. If the token is valid and not expired, the server grants access to the resource. <br />
<span className='font-bold'>Access Token</span><br />
A refresh token is a long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires.
After receiving an access token, the client-side application stores the refresh token securely (usually in an HTTP-only cookie or local storage) and uses it to request a new access token when needed.
When the access token expires, the client sends a request to the server with the refresh token. If the refresh token is valid, the server generates a new access token and returns it to the client. The refresh token itself remains unchanged.
This process allows users to maintain continuous access to protected resources without requiring them to log in again. <br /> <br />
Access tokens should be stored securely, but in a way that allows easy access for API requests. Common storage options on the client-side include browser memory (e.g., JavaScript variables) or in-memory storage options like Redux or React context.
Refresh tokens should be stored in a more secure manner due to their long-lived nature. It is recommended to store them in an HTTP-only cookie or a secure storage mechanism provided by the browser, such as local storage or session storage. Storing them in an HTTP-only cookie helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    2.Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span>
    
    <span className='font-bold'>Data Model:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with predefined schemas. They enforce data consistency and have a well-defined schema that defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data. <br />
NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph. They provide flexible schemas or schemaless designs, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data. <br />
:
<span className='font-bold'>Scalability:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they handle increasing loads by increasing the hardware resources of a single server (e.g., CPU, RAM). They have limitations in scaling horizontally across multiple servers. <br />
NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers or clusters, making it easier to handle large-scale applications and high volumes of data. <br />

<span className='font-bold'>Query Language:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized syntax for creating, modifying, and retrieving data using relational algebra and SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. br
NoSQL: NoSQL databases may have their own query languages specific to the data model they use. Some NoSQL databases offer SQL-like query interfaces, while others use APIs or custom query <br />

<span className='font-bold'>Flexibility and Schema Evolution:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data is defined in advance. Altering the schema can be complex and may require migrations or downtime. <br />
NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer more flexibility in terms of schema. They can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, and the schema can evolve over time without requiring predefined schemas or <br />

<span className='font-bold'>ACID Transactions:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases traditionally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency. They provide strict transactional guarantees. <br />
NoSQL: NoSQL databases vary in their support for ACID transactions. Some NoSQL databases sacrifice ACID guarantees in favor of performance and scalability, offering eventual consistency or relaxed transactional models. <br />

<span className='font-bold'>Use Cases:</span><br />
SQL: SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex querying, strong data consistency, and transactions. They are commonly used in traditional relational data scenarios such as e-commerce, banking, and enterprise systems. <br />
NoSQL: NoSQL databases excel in handling large amounts of unstructured or rapidly changing data, providing high scalability, and accommodating agile development practices. They are often used in real-time analytics, content management systems, social networks, IoT applications, and big data projects.

    4.What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?

</h2>
<p><span className='font-semibold'>Answer: </span>

In MongoDB, the aggregate operation is used to perform advanced data aggregation and transformation tasks on the documents within a collection. It allows you to process multiple documents and apply a series of operations to them, producing a result based on the specified aggregation pipeline.

The aggregation pipeline consists of a sequence of stages, each representing an operation to be performed on the documents. These stages can include operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, transforming, joining, and calculating aggregate values. The output of one stage serves as the input for the next stage, allowing you to build complex data processing pipelines.</p>
